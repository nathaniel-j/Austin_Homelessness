# RETHINKING HOMELESS METRICS

The city of Austin currently measures its homeless population and its performance in addressing homelessness using a handfull of metrics that paint the homeless as a relatively static population that simply needs to be housed to end homelessness. Here are a few of the current dashboards in use:

- [City strategic performance measures](https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/Health/iane-nkjw/)
- [Austin ECHO measures](https://www.austinecho.org/about-echo/homelessness-in-austin/)
- [Imagine Austin Indicators](https://data.austintexas.gov/stories/s/Household-Affordability/czit-acu8)
- [Homeless Response System Performance Dashboard](https://www.austinecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AustinCoCDashboardPhase3_20211011_update.html#annual-enrollment)
