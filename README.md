# Austin_Homelessness
### Description and analysis of homelessness in Austin, TX. 
With this project I am performing a thorough description and analysis of homelessness in Austin within the context of Texas and the US. The analysis will have 3 principle components:

1) Describe and compare general trends in homelessness across the city, state and national levels. This will answer broad questions like:
- how many people are homeless each year?
- is homelessness rising or falling over time?
- does Austin have higher homelessness rates than the state level, national level, or other metropolitan areas?

2) Examine how the current system performs and measures success. 
- what are Austin's goals for addressing homelessness?
- how much is the city spending to meet those goals, and how is the money being allocated?
- how is the city measuring program performance?

3) Look for opportunities to improve the system's performance. 
- how well are Austin's investments in addressing homelessness performing?
- are there opportunities to improve investment performance?
